# TaxiRadar
Taxi Radar: A predictive model to forecast high-demand areas for taxis using ML and DL techniques

• Predicts taxi demand with Random Forest Regressor and geospatial analysis.

• Analyzes locations, timestamps, and time intervals.

• Forecasts high-demand areas in 2-hour intervals.

• Optimizes taxi fleet management and urban transport.

• Enables smarter, data-driven decisions.


**TaxiRadar** is a machine learning project that predicts high-demand taxi pick-up locations in real-time, using a combination of historical data, real-time weather, and traffic information. The project is designed to assist taxi drivers in optimizing their routes and increasing their pick-up efficiency by suggesting nearby locations with high demand.

## Project Overview

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Regression and LSTM models
- **Accuracy Achieved**: Over 90%
- **Key Features**:
  - Predicts taxi demand based on historical and real-time data
  - Visualizes the top locations with predicted high demand
  - Calculates distance from the current location to suggested high-demand locations
